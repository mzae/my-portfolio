Hi, I'm ** Daniel Wanjama** — an Azure cloud security enthusiast with a sharp eye for identity, access, and automation.  
This portfolio is a living showcase of my journey through Microsoft Entra ID, Zero Trust architecture, and secure infrastructure design.

From scripting bulletproof file organizers to documenting real-world labs on Conditional Access, Privileged Identity Management, and secure storage endpoints — I’m building a toolkit that’s not just functional, but resilient.

Explore my labs, walkthroughs, and technical write-ups as I turn cloud theory into hardened practice.
