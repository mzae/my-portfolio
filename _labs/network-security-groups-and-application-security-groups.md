## Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to secure Azure virtual machines using **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** and **Application Security Groups (ASGs)**. By logically grouping VMs and applying targeted inbound rules, I isolated traffic for **Web Servers** and **Management Servers**, enhancing role-based access control and overall cloud security posture.

---

## Objectives

- Create resource group and virtual network  
- Define Application Security Groups (ASGs)  
- Deploy virtual machines for web and management roles  
- Associate NICs with ASGs  
- Configure NSGs with role-based inbound rules  
- Validate traffic filtering and rule enforcement  

---

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with contributor or admin access  
- Skillable lab environment or Azure sandbox  
- Familiarity with Azure Portal and VM deployment  

---

## Walkthrough

### Task 1: Create Resource Group & Virtual Network

- Created resource group `RG-SecurityLab` in East Africa  
- Deployed virtual network `VNet-SecurityLab` with subnets for Web and Management servers

### Task 2: Create Application Security Groups

- Created ASG `ASG-Web` for web servers  
- Created ASG `ASG-Management` for management servers

### Task 3: Deploy Virtual Machines

- Deployed Web Server VM with IIS installed  
- Deployed Management Server VM configured for RDP access  
ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot: `step03-web-vm.png` â€“ Web VM deployment*

---

### Task 4: Associate NICs with ASGs

- Associated Web VM NIC with `ASG-Web`  
- Associated Management VM NIC with `ASG-Management`  
ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot: `step04-nic-asg.png` â€“ NIC association with ASGs*

---

### Task 5: Configure Network Security Groups

- Created NSG for Web servers: allowed HTTP (port 80), blocked RDP  
- Created NSG for Management servers: allowed RDP (port 3389) from trusted IPs, blocked HTTP  
ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot: `step05-nsg-web.png` â€“ NSG for web access*

---

### Task 6: Validate Traffic Filtering

- Verified Web Server accessible via browser on port 80  
- Verified Management Server accessible via RDP from admin workstation  
ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot: `step06-iis-access.png` â€“ IIS access test*  
![IIS Access](../../assets/images/labs/step06-iis-access.png)

ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot: `step06-rdp-access.png` â€“ RDP access test*

---

### Task 7: Final Validation

- Used Azure Network Watcher to confirm traffic flow matches NSG rules  
ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot: `step07-network-watcher.png` â€“ Network Watcher validation*

## Key Learnings

- ASGs simplify rule management by grouping VMs logically  
- NSGs enforce traffic filtering based on ASG membership  
- Role-based access improves security posture in cloud environments
