# Lab 6: Service Endpoints and Securing Storage

**Student Name:** Daniel Wanjama  
**Student ID:** ADC-CSS02-25012  

---

## Introduction

This walkthrough guides you through Lab 06 of the Microsoft ADC Cybersecurity Skilling Program, focusing on securing Azure Storage using Service Endpoints and Network Security Groups (NSGs). You'll restrict access to storage accounts via virtual network subnets, ensuring traffic stays within the Azure backbone.

---

## Objectives

- Configure Azure Service Endpoints for a storage account  
- Set up Network Security Groups to control subnet access  
- Deploy virtual machines in isolated subnets to test connectivity  
- Validate secure access to Azure Storage  

---

## Prerequisites

- Active Azure subscription  
- Familiarity with Azure Portal, virtual networks, and storage accounts  
- Access to Azure Cloud Shell or PowerShell  

---
