## üß≠ Introduction

This lab explores Microsoft‚Äôs cloud security tools including Microsoft 365 tenant setup, Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs), Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Sentinel, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Each tool plays a role in protecting identities, networks, applications, and data in the cloud.

## üîê Lab 1: Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)

### Task 1: View VM Details
- Access the Azure portal and locate the pre-created VM.
- Review VM configuration and network interface.

### Task 2: Create NSG and Add RDP Rule
- Create a new NSG named `NSG-SC900`.
- Associate it with the VM‚Äôs NIC.
- Add inbound rule for RDP (port 3389).

- ![Add RDP Rule](/assets/images/labs/lab1-nsg-task2-add-rdp-rule.png)

### Task 3: Test RDP and Outbound Access
- Use ‚ÄúCheck Access‚Äù to verify RDP connectivity.
- Connect via Native RDP and test outbound internet access.

- ![Outbound Access](/assets/images/labs/lab1-nsg-task3-outbound-access-check.png)

### Task 4: Block Outbound Internet
- Create outbound rule to deny traffic to `Internet` service tag.
- Test by attempting to access `www.bing.com` from the VM.

## üßæ Conclusion

Completing these labs provided hands-on experience with Microsoft‚Äôs cloud security ecosystem. Key takeaways include:

- Identity and access management via Microsoft 365
- Traffic control using NSGs
- Threat detection with Defender and Sentinel
- App governance through Defender for Cloud Apps

Security is a layered approach‚Äîthese tools work together to protect cloud environments from evolving threats. This lab was a major step in my cloud security journey, and I‚Äôm excited to apply what I‚Äôve learned in real-world scenarios.
