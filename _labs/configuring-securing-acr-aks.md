## Introduction

This lab was completed as part of the Microsoft ADC Cybersecurity Skilling Program. It focuses on configuring and securing Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The goal was to gain hands-on experience deploying containerized applications in Azure, managing access controls, and applying cloud-native security practices.

---

## Objectives

- Create and configure Azure Container Registry  
- Build and push Docker image to ACR  
- Deploy AKS cluster and configure secure image pull  
- Assign roles and permissions for AKS-ACR integration  
- Deploy external and internal Kubernetes services  
- Validate access, networking, and dashboard visibility  
- Apply YAML configurations and verify updates  
- Perform resource cleanup and reflect on key learnings  

---

## Walkthrough

### Task 1: Create Azure Container Registry

- Created private ACR instance named `acrsecuritylab`  
- Selected Basic SKU and East Africa region

## Conclusion

This lab provided hands-on experience with deploying and securing containerized applications in Azure. I learned how to:

- Build and store Docker images in ACR  
- Deploy AKS clusters and configure secure image pulls  
- Assign roles and manage access controls  
- Deploy and test both external and internal services  
- Scale deployments using YAML and verify rollout  
- Review network security and isolate workloads  
- Clean up resources responsibly to manage costs  

These skills are foundational for cloud security and DevOps workflows. I now feel confident applying these practices in real-world environments and freelance projects.
