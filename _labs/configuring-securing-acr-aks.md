## Introduction

This lab walkthrough documents the configuration and security of Azure Container Registry (ACR) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), including role assignments, firewall rules, DNS settings, and validation steps. It demonstrates real-world cloud security practices using Azure CLI, PowerShell, and the Azure Portal.

---

## Step 1: Launch Cloud Shell and Prepare for AKS Deployment

I began by launching Azure Cloud Shell and reviewing the tutorial instructions for deploying AKS and ACR. This step sets the foundation for the lab.

## Step 2: Troubleshoot Deployment Policy Restriction

While deploying the AKS cluster, I encountered a policy error due to location restrictions. Azure Policy blocked the resource creation, which I resolved by selecting an approved region.

## Step 3: View Resource Groups in Azure Portal

I reviewed existing resource groups to confirm the correct environment and subscription context before proceeding with cluster and registry setup.

## Step 4: Assign AcrPull Role to AKS Identity

To allow AKS to pull images from ACR securely, I assigned the `AcrPull` role to the clusterâ€™s managed identity using the Azure Portal.

## Step 5: Configure Azure Firewall Application Rule

I created an application rule collection named `AllowGvn` to permit outbound HTTPS access to specific domains like Google and Bing.

---

## Step 6: Add Network Rule Collection

To control internal traffic, I added a network rule collection that allows UDP traffic between defined IP ranges and ports.

---

## Step 7: Configure Custom DNS Servers

I configured custom DNS servers (Google and Cloudflare) on the `nic-firewall` network interface to ensure reliable name resolution.

---

## Step 8: Validate Firewall Rules from Test VM

Using `nslookup` and `curl` from the test VM, I validated that outbound traffic was correctly routed through Azure Firewall.

---

## Step 9: Create Virtual Network and Subnets

I created a virtual network named `FirewallVNet` with three subnets: `AzureFirewallSubnet`, `Workload-SN`, and `Jump-SN`, to segment traffic and enforce security boundaries.

---

## Step 10: Test Access to Workload VM

I logged into the workload VM (`rsrv-lwrk`) via Remote Desktop and confirmed connectivity and profile loading.

---

## Step 11: Confirm Public IP Routing via Browser

From the VM, I browsed to `http://10.0.1.4` and `http://10.0.2.4` to test firewall rules. The first succeeded, the second was blocked â€” confirming rule enforcement.

---

## Step 12: Terminate Remote Desktop Sessions and Begin Cleanup

After validation, I terminated all RDP sessions and began resource cleanup to avoid unnecessary charges.

---

## Step 13: Create Resource Group via PowerShell

Using Azure Cloud Shell, I created a new resource group named `AZ500LabRG`.

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "AZ500LabRG" -Location "East US"
```

ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot:*

---

## Step 14: Remove AzureFirewallRG via PowerShell

I removed the `AzureFirewallRG` resource group using PowerShell to clean up lab resources.

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name AzureFirewallRG -Force -AsJob
```

ðŸ“¸ *Screenshot:*

---

## Step 15: Verify Azure Firewall Deployment

Finally, I verified the Azure Firewall deployment status using PowerShell.

```powershell
Get-AzFirewall -ResourceGroupName AzureResourceGroup
```

## Conclusion

This lab demonstrates end-to-end deployment and security configuration for ACR and AKS, including:

- Role-based access control  
- DNS and firewall rule enforcement  
- Network segmentation  
- Real-world validation from VMs  
- Resource cleanup using PowerShell

It reflects my ability to troubleshoot, automate, and document technical workflows in a cloud security context.
