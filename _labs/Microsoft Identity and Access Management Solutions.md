# Microsoft ADC Cybersecurity Skilling Program

## Week 2 Lab Assignment â€“ Microsoft Identity and Access Management Solutions

### Student Details
- **Name:** Daniel Wanjama  
- **Student ID:** ADC-CSS02-25012  
- **Program:** Microsoft ADC Cybersecurity Skilling Program  

---

## Introduction
This lab focused on exploring the capabilities of Microsoft Identity and Access Management Solutions using the Skillable Learn on Demand portal. The primary tool was **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)**, where I performed hands-on tasks to manage and customize user identities, enable security features, and configure access policies.

---

## Lab 1: Explore Microsoft Entra ID User Settings
- Logged in as administrator to Microsoft Entra ID portal.
- Reviewed and modified user settings for assigned accounts.
- Managed user roles and configured specific access parameters.
- Ensured audit logging and monitoring capabilities were enabled.

**Key Learning:**  
I learned how to enable Microsoft 365 audit log and file monitoring, manage user identities, and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

## Lab 2: Microsoft Entra Self-Service Password Reset
- Configured and tested self-service password reset for users.
- Validated authentication methods (e.g., SMS, email, or app-based recovery).
- Tested user experience for password reset under different scenarios.

**Key Learning:**  
This lab reinforced how to configure secure self-service password reset (SSPR) in Entra ID, ensuring user autonomy and reducing administrative overhead.

## Lab 3: Microsoft Entra Conditional Access
- Created conditional access policies based on location and device compliance.
- Tested sign-in scenarios to validate policy enforcement.
- Enabled MFA for sensitive resources.

**Key Learning:**  
I learned how to enhance access control through conditional policies, strengthening identity-based security.

## Lab 4: Explore Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
- Enabled Privileged Identity Management in Microsoft Entra ID.
- Assigned just-in-time (JIT) privileged roles to administrators.
- Configured approval workflows for elevated permissions.

**Key Learning:**  
PIM allows secure, time-bound administrative access, reducing the risk of privilege misuse.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I gained hands-on experience in Microsoft Identity and Access Management, covering user settings, SSPR, conditional access, and privileged identity management. These skills enhance my ability to implement **Zero Trust principles** and enforce secure access control across cloud environments.
