## Introduction

This lab explores core components of Microsoftâ€™s identity and access management solutions, including Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR), Conditional Access, and Privileged Identity Management (PIM). Through hands-on tasks, I configured user settings, enabled audit logging, enforced access policies, and managed privileged roles to strengthen cloud security posture.

## Objectives

- Configure Microsoft Entra ID user settings and roles  
- Enable Microsoft 365 audit logging and file monitoring  
- Implement Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)  
- Create Conditional Access policies  
- Manage privileged roles using PIM  

---

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with admin access  
- Skillable lab environment  
- Familiarity with Microsoft 365 and Azure Portal
